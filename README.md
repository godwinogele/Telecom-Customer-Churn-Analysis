# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis

This README file accompanies the project analyzing customer churn in the Telecom industry, utilizing  SPSS for data analysis..

# Project Overview:

The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. By understanding the reasons behind churn, telecom companies can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

# Data Source:

The data for this analysis was obtained from a publicly available Telecom Customer Churn dataset (https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-churn-challenge/6).

# Analysis Steps:

# 1. Data Preparation:

The data was loaded from a CSV file named telecom_customer_churn.csv.
Descriptive statistics were computed for key variables.

# 2. Frequency Analysis:

Frequencies were calculated for various customer service subscriptions to understand their distribution among customers.

# 3. Cross-tabulation:

Cross-tabulation was performed to explore the relationship between churn category (churned vs. not churned), churn reason, and service subscriptions.

# 4. Results and Findings:

The analysis yielded valuable insights into customer churn behavior:

# a. Service Preferences:
i. Phone and internet services were near-universally subscribed to (over 78%).
ii. Value-added services like online security, online backup, and device protection had moderate adoption rates (around 29-34%).
iii. Premium tech support and streaming services were used by a significant portion of customers (around 29% and 40% respectively).
iv. Most customers opted for unlimited data plans (around 67%).
v. A majority of customers (over 50%) were on month-to-month contracts.

# b. Churn and Service Subscriptions:
i. Customers who churned due to dissatisfaction were less likely to have subscribed to value-added services like online security and tech support.
ii. Customers with premium tech support showed lower churn rates due to service issues.
iii. Month-to-month contracts exhibited higher churn rates compared to longer contracts.

# Conclusion
The analysis highlights the importance of understanding customer service preferences and churn reasons. Telecom companies can leverage these insights to:

i. Promote value-added services that address customer concerns and enhance satisfaction.
ii. Offer incentives for longer-term contracts to encourage customer loyalty.
iii. Prioritize proactive customer service to prevent dissatisfaction-driven churn.
